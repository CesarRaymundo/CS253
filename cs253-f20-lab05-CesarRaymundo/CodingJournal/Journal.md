I tried completing the lab warmup by myself since I have had issues understading nested for loops in the past. I had the code right for the most part. I was able to make a triangle with the specified character. But my problem was that it wasn't the right height. After a further look and looking at the warmup video, I saw that I was missing a "+1" on my second for loop. Which is  why my program was printing a height that was a one row short.

I was overcomplicating the lab activity. For some reason I thought you needed all your for loops nested, but I quickly realized that it caused a whole lot of issues with my program. Once I separated the arrow base and arrow head to their own nested for loops. My program started to run and my output was starting to output what I wanted.

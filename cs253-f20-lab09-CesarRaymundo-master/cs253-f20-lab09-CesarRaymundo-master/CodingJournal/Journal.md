This is week is definetly the harderst week we have had for sure! There's a lot to learn about pointers and memory allocation. At the end of the zybooks, I was still a little clustered on all the material we went over, but luckily the deeper look video helped me out. I got a better understanding on the material and was able to understand the lab warmup and complete it with ease.

Wow, this week was the hardest for sure! The lab activity was no joke and I had a hard time with it. I was able to complete PlaylisNode.c fairly easily since the .h file was given to us and I had a good understanding on what each method is supposed to do. But the main file is where I had a lot of issues with. First, I had a lot of issues compiling my main.c file. The terminal kept telling me that I have an error with my makefile and that it was expecting a different value. I had no idea what was up with it, but a lot of deleting code and adding more got rid of that problem. The next issue that I ran into is memory allocation. This I am not sure how to fix, I do not know what went wrong with my code to cause this. I tried using the debugger on this IDE but have no idea how to run it. Also, I tried to mess with my variables and their locations within main, nothing changed. I keep getting a segmentation fault and looked up online for suggestions but found nothing. Overall, my code isn't working properly but did implement all the options for the playlist menu.

### November 9th, 2020
I completed the LabWarmup and overall, I enjoyed this week's material. This week went smoother and faster than the past 3 weeks, so it was refreshing. This week we learned about file and much of it reminded me of how we do it in Java. Luke was very good to point out the differences in his videos. His walkthrough on the warmup also made a lot of sense and helped me finish this warmup with ease/

### November 9th, 2020
I completed the lab activity and it went fairly well for the most part. The new material learned was not complicated to implement. Since most of it was fairly similar to the warmup from this week. One thing I struggled with and still am struggling with is pointers. I still not fairly sure when and when not use them in my program. I was having an issue with my qsort method and was getting a segmentation fault. I was having issues running the debugger and got tutor help. They helped me realize that I was missing some pointers and tried to explain when to use them, but I don't believe I fully understand that topic just yet.

During the lab activity I was having the issue of not being able to put in an input for the second service. Everytime I would finish typing and entering the first service, it would end the program right after. I didn't catch this problem until after finishing up writing all my code. I didnt't know what the issue was at first but with a little digging around I remembered I had the same issue with lab03 wamrmup. The scanner was reading the newline, so I just had to add a space before "%" for my second scanf and my problem was fixed.

I am not sure if I approached the last half of the activity the right way. What I mean by that is the way I calculated my totals. I used if statemnents and string compare to add up my totals but I am not sure if this was the most effecient way to get these totals and would like feedback if there is a better way to do this.

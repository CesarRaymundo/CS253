Just finished the lab warmup and it was pretty useful. It helped me understand how arrays work in C and how it differs in Java. The warmup was also very useful for the activity this week. Of course that is the goal for every warmup each week, but this helps out a lot since we are starting to do a little more advance coding in C as the weeks progress.

const int TEAM_SIZE (Data Segment) 
double maxWeight (Data Segment) 
double totalWeight (Data Segment) 
double teamWeights[TEAM_SIZE] (Heap Segment)

After finishing the lab activity, I have concluded that I was making things a lot harder than they should be. To start, I wasn't sure how I wanted to go about doing the menu option, but after a understanding more of the goal of the program and remembering I have done CS121, I knew that switch statements were the best way to do the menu options. I went ahead and looked at my textbook to see how switch statements are done in C and realize it is basically identical to Java. After that, I was able to complete the activity which was definitely a fun one.

 const int TEAM_SIZE (Data Segment) 
 int jersey[TEAM_SIZE];(Heap Segment)
 int rating[TEAM_SIZE];(Heap Segment)
 char option (Data Segment) 
 int jer = 0, rate = 0, index, k = 0; (Data Segment)

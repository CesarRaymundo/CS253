I completed a quarter of the lab activity until I was having laptop issues. I wasn't able to rum my virtual machine and watch Luke's video at the same time, this caused me just to wait until I was able to return to my PC back at Boise. But so far, I am enjoying the material we are learning.

I struggled with being able to get setup with my PC now. I decided to start on the activity late today since I knew it was a walkthrough, but ended struggle with even getting my virtual machine started. I did an update on my virtual machine on my PC and was not able to establish a connection, I do not know what happened. I followed some steps they provided but failed on getting a successful boot. So I struggled with finish this last activity due to hardware problems.

I was having issues with the lab warmup. The main thing that was giving me issues was that I wasn't able to prompt the user to enter a character. At first I was trying to do this lab warmup by myself and couldn't find the issue after looking back at zyBooks. I wasn't sure what the problem was, so I decided to watch the video and realized that Luke also came across the same issue. After watching his explanation it all made sense and was able to finish the warmup.

The second issue I came across on was when doing the lab activity. I wasn't able to run one line of code towards the end when calculating the gallons needed of paint. It just kept jumping my print statment for the gallons needed and I wasn't sure why. But after further expecting my code, I noticed that I forgot to put a semicolon after calculating my gallons needed. Which made my code jump that line and end.

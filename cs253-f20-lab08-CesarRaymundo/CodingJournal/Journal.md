After finishing reading the zyBooks portion of this week module, I was still confused om structs for C and also the difference between .h and .c files. So, whem I tried to start the lab warmup, I was a little lost. I went back to see the deeper look videos and that's when things started to make more sense. The examples and exlpanations Lucas gave helped me understand the concept more and now I feel more confident to start the lab activity.

I started this week assignment on Friday and got 1/3 of the activity done, but when I jumped back on to finish I lost track of my methods I created since I didn't put any definitions or comments to help remind me. So, I spent awhile looking back at the guide to understand what exactly is going on. After that, I was able to finsh the activity. I did have a couple bugs here and there on my methods and I'm still not completely sure I fully understand pointers yet. I don't know when I should and shouldn't use them, but hopefully we more into detail with them in class.

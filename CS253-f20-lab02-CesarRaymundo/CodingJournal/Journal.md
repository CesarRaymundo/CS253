While I was working on the labwarmup, I was trying to challenge myself and do it by myself. I would allow myself to only view the README and go from their. I found myself tying to program in java and kept making simple errors that would throw exceptions when trying to run. I decide to look at the video afterwards and saw my mistake and corrected my work accordingly.

Not a lot went wrong when working on the lab activity. One place where I did mess up was drawing the cat. I couldn't show the output of the ears when running and I wasn't quite sure why. But after looking over the README again, I found what my issue was. Another place where I messed up was syntax error. I kept finding myself forgetting to add quotes and finishing off statements with a semi colon.

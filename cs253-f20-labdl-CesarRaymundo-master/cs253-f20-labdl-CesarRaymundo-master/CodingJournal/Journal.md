I just completed my .c file for DataNodes and it took me way longer than I ever expected. I am glad that we were able to test of class with the created tests Luke has made. I kept getting a segmentation fault after build/destroy node passed. I knew it was a memory allocation error from my previous experiences and online research. I went back and looked at the tests file and saw that I was failing at testLargeString. I went back to my createDataNode method and realized I wasn't making dymaic memory from my string corretly and was able to fix it after a couple of trails and errors. I also had other errors with tests, but were smaller issues. Such as, pointers, wrong variables, not traversing correctly, etc.

Completed my main.c and was not as hard as I was making it to be. At first, I really wasn't sure how to bring all the material together now and make a database using the linked list. I was trying a couple of various ways to imlpement the data, but kept getting errors or warnings. Then, I waited for a tutoring session with Brandon. Thankfully, Brandon helped me to figure out what I was doing wrong and pushed to the right direction to implement the list correctly. Once I got that help, I was able to complete this week's activity.

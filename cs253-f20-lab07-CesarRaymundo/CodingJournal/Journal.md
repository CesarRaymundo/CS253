I completed the lab warmup and I really got some useful information from this one. I was able to understand how to make our own methods in C more clearly. Also, I now understand how to implement our own methods as well. By no surprise, they are very similar to Java, but a few different ways to delcare variables here and there. But overall very useful material we are learning.

After finishing the lab activity, I was very satisfied with my results. All my methods seemed to be working as they should. I did however struggle with the shortenspace method. I wasn't able to called the method wihtin menuprompt and print the edited string and had to call it in within the method. I also learned how to use pointers while doing if statements, since I had to do this for my shortenspace method.
